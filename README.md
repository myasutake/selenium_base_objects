# Selenium Base Objects and Tutorial
This project serves two purposes:
1. Selenium Base Objects library
2. Selenium tutorial and examples
## Selenium Base Objects
If you're already comfortable with Selenium and the concept of page objects, but need some inspiration to get your own page objects architecture started, feel free to snag [page_objects/base.py](page_objects/base.py) and add it to your project.
